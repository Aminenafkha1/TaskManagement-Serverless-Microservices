Include the following information in your report:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Any possible mitigations** you've identified
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### What to Expect

When you report a vulnerability, here's what you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment** - We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 2 business days
2. **Assessment** - We'll assess the vulnerability and determine its severity within 5 business days
3. **Updates** - We'll keep you informed of our progress as we work on a fix
4. **Resolution** - We'll notify you when the vulnerability has been resolved
5. **Recognition** - With your permission, we'll recognize your contribution in our security acknowledgments

### Vulnerability Assessment

We classify vulnerabilities using the following severity levels:

- **Critical** - Immediate threat to user data or system integrity
- **High** - Significant impact on security or functionality
- **Medium** - Moderate impact with limited scope
- **Low** - Minor security concerns

### Response Timeline

| Severity | Initial Response | Target Resolution |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 24 hours        | 7 days           |
